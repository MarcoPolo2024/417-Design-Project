# All preliminary calculations have been carried out on the basis of constant mean diameter. Another problem aries whenever a sketch of the compressor is drawn.
# The current design shows that the combustor will have an irregular shape requiring changes in the flow direction casusing additional pressure losses. 
# A more satifactory solution would be to design the compressor for a constant outer diameter which results in the mean blade speed increasing with stage number which in
# turn implies that for a given temperature rise the change in whirl velocity is reduced. The fluid direction is correspondingly reduced with a beneficial increase in deHaller number.
# Alternatively because of the higher blade speed a higher temperature rise could be achieved in the later stages which might permit the required pressure ratio to be obtained in six stages rather than seven.
# It is then necessary to use appropriate values of U1 and U2 in which the stage temperature rise would be given by lambda*(U2*V_U_2 - U_1*V_U_1) / c_P
# Constant outer diameter compressors  are used when the minimum number of stages is required and these are commonly found in aircraft engines
# Can carry out the preceding calculations using an increased axial velocity of 200 m/s. The increased inlet velocity decreases the annulus area required but using a hub-tip ratio of 0.6 a tip diameter of 0.2207m is obtained compared with 
# 0.2262m for the previous design. The mean blade speed is inceased to 280.1 m/s and it is found that the pressure ratio of 4.15 can be achieved with five stages.
# IF a constant outer diameter configuration were used it is likely that the requirement could be achieved with a four stage compressor using current technology

# Variation of air angles from root to tip

# Various distributions of whirl velocity with mean radius can be considered and it was shown that the designer has quite a wide choice
# In the case of the first stage however the choice is restricted because of the absence of IGVs this means that there are no whirl component at entry to the compressor and the inlet velocity  will be constant across the annulus
# For all other stages the whirl velocity at entry to the rotor blades will be determined by the axial and the stator outlet angle from the previous stage giving more freedom in the aerodyamic design of the stage
# In this case the first stage will be investigated using a free vortex design, noting that the condition V_U*r = const is satisfied for V_U = 0
# Attention will then be turned to the design of the third stage recalling that the mean radius design was based on Lambda = 0.50
# Third stage will be investigated for three different design approaches (i) free vortex Lambda = 0.50, (ii) constant reaction Lambda = 0.50 with a radial equilibrium ignored and eponential blading Lambda = 0.50
# Considering the first stage the rotor blade angle at inlet beta1 is obtained directly from the axial velocity (150m/s) and the blade speed.
